\section{Lessons Learned Perspective} \label{sec:lessons}

One of the biggest issues throughout the project was to setup new services in Docker. We did not have prior experience with many of the services such as Grafana, Prometheus, and Kibana. Getting these services to work properly took us a decent amount of time. There was not a simple solution, other than trying until we got it right. Working with docker we found out it is hard to narrow down a reason to a problem as the logs are not always that elaborate.
